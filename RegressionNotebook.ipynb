Although the male_dv variable is not significant, if it were, I could interpret the odds ratio as \"Men are 20% more likely to support additional housing supply than those who didn't identify as men.\"  For own, which is significant, I can interpret it as \"Owners were about half as likely to support new housing supply (1-.52), even after controlling for gender.
