    "## Many ways to accomplish a task\n",
    "\n",
    "There are almost always multiple ways to accomplish a given task in a full-featured programming language like Python. Different approaches have different merits, which can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **readability**: how easy is it for someone else (or future you) to read and understand what the code is doing?\n",
    "* **reusability**: how well suited is the code for reuse elsewhere, or for extension to multiple inputs or different datasets?\n",
    "* **speed**: how quickly does the code run? Different approaches may take orders of magnitude more or less time to perform the same work.\n",
    "* **conciseness**: is the code nice and brief, as short as it can be but not shorter?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you should *prioritize readability over all others*, because the time it takes you to figure out what the heck you were doing when you wrote that code is measured in seconds at best and days at worst, while the time your code takes to run is usually measured in nanoseconds at best and minutes at worst. However, speed can really start to matter as your datasets get larger and larger, and your code runs more and more frequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will suggest approaches that prioritize readability/simplicity, especially because many of you are just getting started with Python/pandas. We don't have time to note all the other ways of doing things, but just remember that they often do exist, so feel free to play around!"

It, in turn, points us toward the [API Discovery Tool](https://api.census.gov/data.html), which begins with a downright intimidating and frankly not very useful list of ALL datasets available via the API. Whew! The easiest way to work with this table is by searching it... Search this page for \"2023/acs/acs5\" - we're looking for the \"American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates: Detailed Tables 5-Year\" row, which is near the bottom. \n",

The \"[variables](https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5/variables.html)\" link takes you to a table of all variables available in the ACS dataset. Maybe even more useful is the \"[groups](https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5/groups.html)\" link, whose table lists all \"groups\" of ACS variables, i.e. tables. The \"groups\" table is very helpful: you can search or scan through it for tables that may be relevant to the question at hand. \n",

    "3. Variables ending in `M` are *margins of error*, i.e. how precise the estimate is. The Census Bureau provides margins of error for a 90% confidence level; that is, we can be 90% confident that the true value is somewhere in the interval $[estimate - MOE, estimate + MOE]$.\n",
    "4. Variables ending in `MA` are annotations of the margins of error.
