    "\n",
    "The goal for lecture today is to play with a Jupyter Notebook and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data. The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser. It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively. We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now. Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook. Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.\n",

It is thought the average cost of new homes, 7,200, including lot and financing, may constitute an over-improvement. The upper part of this area is known as Wilshire Heights. A speculative, Mr. F.T.

It is still too sparsely settled to predict a definite trend. The area was first put on as a subdivision in 1927 and many building and loan associations placed construction loans here. A number of these loans were foreclosed during the depression period and in consequence, there was an extraordinary drop in values. Some of the more pretentious homes, selling for as little as one-third of their original cost. For these reasons, recovery of values have been slow and halting(?) in comparison with some of the older areas. There is a new highway under construction through the area at the present time and since January 1, 1937, there has been a renewed sales activity here. David D. Bohanon, a speculative builder, has purchased a large number of lots in this area and recently started a program of construction, which comtemplates the building of between three hundred and four hundred, five and six-room houses, the sale price of which will be about $4.50 per square foot, plus the price of the lot, which will average in the neighborhood of $1,000. The architecture and type of homes which already have been completed is such that if, so and when, the program is finished, it is possible that that particular portion of the area should be raised as an \\&quot;A\\&quot; Green grade. It is understood that this building activity will be largely financed with F.H.A. funds.&quot;, &quot;15&quot;: &quot;Walter N. Gabriel, City of Oakland Building Inspector\\u0027s Office; Ralph E.

However, low percent of land improvements and many favorable factors indicate future prospects of better development. Large contiguous tracts of undeveloped land that can be purchased at acreage prices would seem to offer opportunity for speculation and/or resubdividing. That part of this area lying west of Edwards Avenue was seriously handicapped at the time it was subdivided and placed on the market some twelve years ago. The promoters offered a bonus of $50 worth of lumber with each lot, for the purpose of building temporary shelter. In many cases, the resulting shacks have been added to and improved until now there are many very small, poorly designed dwellings, showing little evidence of pride of ownership. Marketability is limited, values are problematical and the majority of residents have little financial responsibility. The area has been further handicapped by the installation of costly street improvements in 1930, which resulted in heavy property assessments and the subsequent loss of many lots and homes. These street improvements resulted in a scandal, involving several city officials. The bonds which were issued in payment, were sold for as little as twenty cents on the dollar and land values sank to the vanishing point. During the depression there were many foreclosures in this area and a large percentage of vacant houses. Recovery has been slow in a large part of the district. The city owns a reservoir site west of Tiller Avenue and south of Mountain Boulevard. The section east of this reservoir is sparsely settled and gives promise of developing into a higher grade area.&quot;, &quot;15&quot;: &quot;Walter N.

Neighborhoods assigned a value of 2 were also considered \"safe\", were indicated in blue, and borrowers there could get FHA loans. Neighborhoods assigned a value of 3 (yellow) could still get loans, but the appraisers were indicating that they were concerned that the neighborhood was declining. Neighborhoods assigned a value of 4 (red) were considered \"hazardous\" and the federal government refused to guarantee mortgages in those areas.\n"

    "Put \"Redlining Grade\" in the a box and \"Poverty Rate 2017\" in the b box.  How can we interpret the results?  The correlation is a positive .40909, and the line slopes upwards.  This shows that as a census tract's redlining grade gets worse (with 4 being \"redlined\"), the poverty rate goes up.  A correlation coefficient of .4 is considered a \"strong\" correlation (anything above a .3 is meaningful).\n",

    "How about \"Redlining Grade\" correlated with the Percent BA Degree or Higher in 2017.  This time we get a negative correlation coefficient - -0.4173.  This means that there is a negative relationship between a tract's redlining grade and the percent of the population that has a BA - in other words, tracts that were redlined have fewer residents who have completed their BA degree."
